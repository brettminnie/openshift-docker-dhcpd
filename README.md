# Introduction
Container to run dhcpd server

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1. Install podman
2. Install pre-commit `pip3 install pre-commit`
3. Enable pre-commit hooks `pre-commit install`
4. docker/podman build -t dhcpd .


# NB

This container needs to run as root so it can bind to ports 53
